# boloxe-cal

A Vue 3 page that subscribes to several ICS calendar feeds, refreshes them every few minutes, and shows them in four panels:

1. **Monthly overview**: a small month with a colored dot per event. Clicking a day opens that week in the main calendar.
2. **Upcoming events**: the next 7 days, scrollable, grouped by day.
3. **Main calendar**: Month or Week view, with a show/hide chip per calendar and a refresh indicator.
4. **Event details**: shown only while an event is selected.

## Getting started

```sh
npm install
npm run dev       # dev server
npm run build     # production build in dist/
npm run preview   # serve the production build
```

## Configuration

### Calendars

Calendars are declared in `src/config.js`, without their URLs:

```js
export const REFRESH_MINUTES = 5
export const CALENDARS = [
  { id: 'guillaume', name: 'Guillaume', color: '#1badf8' },
  { id: 'familial',  name: 'Familial',  color: '#ffcc00' },
]
```

`name` is optional; if you leave it out, the feed's `X-WR-CALNAME` is used.

### Feed URLs (`.env.local`)

Each calendar's URL goes in `.env.local` as `CAL_<ID>_URL`:

```sh
cp .env.example .env.local
```

```sh
CAL_GUILLAUME_URL=webcal://pXX-caldav.icloud.com/published/2/…
CAL_FAMILIAL_URL=webcal://pXX-caldav.icloud.com/published/2/…
```

- `webcal://` links are accepted and converted to `https://`.
- Restart the dev server after changing `.env.local`.
- Missing variables are reported in the terminal when Vite starts. In the page, that calendar's chip turns red with a ⚠.

**To add a calendar:** add an entry to `CALENDARS`, then add its `CAL_<ID>_URL` line to `.env.local`.

**Why `.env.local` rather than `.env`:** Vite loads both, and `.env.local` overrides `.env`. By convention, `.env` holds shared defaults and is committed, while `*.local` files hold secrets and stay out of git (`.gitignore` excludes them). Private calendar links work like passwords, so they go in `.env.local`. `.env.example` is the committed template.

**Why there's no `VITE_` prefix:** Vite only passes `VITE_*` variables to the browser code. Unprefixed variables are only visible to `vite.config.js`, so the feed URLs never end up in the page's JavaScript.

### Feed proxy

The page never contacts the feed providers itself. It requests `/feeds/<id>`, and `vite.config.js` creates one `server.proxy` route per calendar that forwards the request to the real URL. This means:

- **No CORS requirement:** the request is made by Vite in Node, not by the browser. Google Calendar and iCloud feeds work even though they don't send CORS headers.
- **Private URLs stay private:** they live only in `.env.local` and the Vite process.
- **It works in both modes:** `npm run dev` and `npm run preview` use the same routes. A static host serving `dist/` alone (nginx, GitHub Pages…) has no proxy, so it would need an equivalent rule.

If a feed returns something other than an iCalendar file (for example, the app's own `index.html` when the route is missing), the page shows an error on that calendar instead of failing silently.

Week-view settings are at the top of `src/components/WeekView.vue`:

- `HOUR_PX`: height of one hour, currently 96px.
- `MIN_EVENT_PX`: minimum height of an event, so short events stay readable.
- `FIRST_HOUR`: the hour the grid opens scrolled to, currently 6 AM.

## Stack

| Piece | Version | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **Vue 3** | 3.5 | UI, using the Composition API with `<script setup>` |
| **ical.js** | 2.2 | Parses the `.ics` feeds and expands repeating events |
| **Vite** | 8 | Dev server and production build |
| **@vitejs/plugin-vue** | 6 | Compiles the `.vue` files |

There's no router, state library (Pinia), UI kit, CSS framework or date library. Shared state is a plain composable, styling is scoped CSS, and dates use native `Date` and `Intl`. The production bundle is about 158 KB of JS (54 KB gzipped), and most of that is Vue and ical.js.

## Project layout

    CalendarView.vue           panel 3 toolbar, switches between:
      MonthView.vue
      WeekView.vue
    EventDetail.vue            panel 4
```

## Data flow

### Shared state

`useCalendars.js` keeps its state at module level, outside the function. Every component that calls `useCalendars()` therefore shares the same refs, so all four panels see the same data without Pinia or provide/inject.

- `calendars`: the feeds from `config.js`, plus runtime fields (`visible`, `error`, `loaded`).
- `eventsByCalendar`: the parsed events for each feed.
- `events`: a computed list of every visible event, merged and sorted. All panels read this.
- `selectedEvent`: looked up by id, so a selected event stays selected after a refresh. Each occurrence's id is `calendarId|UID|start`, which stays the same between downloads.
- `now`: a clock that updates every 30 seconds. It drives the "now / in 11 hours" status, the grayed-out past events and the red current-time line.

### Fetching and polling

- `startCalendarSync()` is called once from `App.vue`.
- It downloads all feeds in parallel from `/feeds/<id>` with `fetch(…, { cache: 'no-store' })`, so the browser cache never serves an old copy.
- After each round finishes, it schedules the next one with `setTimeout`. A slow round therefore can't overlap the next one, which `setInterval` could allow.
- The refresh button calls the same `refresh()` and restarts the countdown.
- If a feed fails, its previously loaded events are kept and its chip is outlined in red with a ⚠.

### Parsing with ical.js

1. `ICAL.parse` turns the text into a structure, and `ICAL.Component` and `ICAL.Event` wrap each `VEVENT`.
2. Events are grouped by UID. A modified single occurrence (one with `RECURRENCE-ID`) is attached to its series with `relateException`, so the modified version replaces the original.
3. Repeating events are expanded with `event.iterator()`, but only within ±400 days of today and at most 2,000 occurrences. Without that limit, an endless `RRULE` would expand forever.
4. Each occurrence becomes a plain object (`{ id, title, start, end, allDay, location, description, … }`) with native `Date`s. Times are converted to the browser's time zone at this step.
5. For all-day events, the end date in the feed is the day after the event ends. The detail panel subtracts a day so it shows the actual last day.

## Rendering details

- **Month grids** (`monthGrid()`) always contain whole Sunday-to-Saturday weeks, so a month has 4–6 rows. The CSS row count comes from the number of days.
- **Which events fall on a day** is decided by `occursOn(ev, day)`: an event is included if it overlaps that day at all. That's why a game from 11 PM to 2 AM appears on both days.
- **Week view layout** (`layoutDay()`):
  - Timed events are cut to the day's boundaries and given a minimum length of 30 minutes.
  - They're grouped into clusters of events that overlap each other.
  - Within a cluster, each event goes into the first column that's free at its start time.
  - Width is `100% / column count` and the horizontal position is `column / count`. This is the same simple approach Google and Apple use.
  - Vertical position and height come from `HOUR_PX`.
- **Language:** the interface is in French. Dates are formatted with `Intl.DateTimeFormat` and `Intl.RelativeTimeFormat` using the `LOCALE` constant (`'fr-CA'`) in `utils/date.js`, which gives "mar. 6 oct.", "20 h 00" and "dans 11 heures". `Intl` returns lowercase French ("mardi", "octobre 2026"), so headings go through `capitalize()`. Event titles and notes come from the feeds and stay in their original language.
- **Theme:** colors are CSS variables in `style.css`, with a dark palette under `prefers-color-scheme: dark`. Shades of each calendar's color are made with `color-mix()`, so a new feed only needs one base color in `config.js`.
- **Event notes** are HTML-escaped first and links are added afterwards. Feed text is untrusted, so this keeps the `v-html` safe from injection.

## Limits

- **The proxy needs Vite running:** feeds only load through `npm run dev` or `npm run preview`. See [Feed proxy](#feed-proxy).
- **No server-side cache:** every open tab downloads each feed on every refresh, through the proxy. That's fine on one home computer.
- **Local network:** Vite listens only on `localhost` by default. If you start it with `--host`, devices on your network can open the page. They still can't see the feed URLs, but they can read the calendars through `/feeds/<id>`.
- **Nothing is saved between visits:** which calendars are hidden and the last fetched data are lost on reload. You could save them in `localStorage` with a few lines, or show cached data while offline.
- **Time zones:** it relies on ical.js's time-zone handling. `VTIMEZONE` blocks inside the feed work. A `TZID` with no definition in the feed falls back to "floating" local time.
- **No tests yet.** `utils/date.js` and `layoutDay()` are pure functions, so they'd be the easiest place to start with Vitest, which plugs straight into the existing Vite setup.
